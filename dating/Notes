Things that are farther away move first. Move if able. Swap if beneficial for both. dist after swap < dist 

attributes = {1...n}
weights = w_1 ... w_n from (-1 ... 1)

In each response, P may modify 5% of the criteria (P may choose which ones) by 20% each with respect to the original weights. 
w_i' = w_i +/- (.05 * w_i)

attributes <= 200 
0 <= a_i <= 1

Candidate = c_1 ... c_n

Take dot product of w_i' * c_i to get score
-1 <= score <= 1

Compare players by (score, num turns).
